                <h3>Web Developement</h3>
                <p>Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves
                    a range of activities, from building the structure of a site to designing its look and
                    functionality.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Front-end Developement</h3>
                <p>Front-end development focuses on the user interface and experience. It involves creating the visual
                    elements of a website or application that users interact with directly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Back-end Developement</h3>
                <p>Back-end development deals with the server-side of a web application. It involves creating the logic,
                    databases, and server interactions necessary for the functionality of the application.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>HTML, CSS and Javascript</h3>
                <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the core technologies that power the web. HTML (HyperText Markup
                    Language) forms the backbone of web pages, providing the structure and content. It uses a system of
                    tags to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images. CSS (Cascading Style
                    Sheets) builds on this foundation by controlling the presentation and layout of the content. Through
                    CSS, developers can specify styles like colors, fonts, margins, and positioning, allowing for a
                    visually appealing and organized design. JavaScript, on the other hand, brings interactivity and
                    dynamic functionality to web pages. It enables developers to create features such as form
                    validation, animations, and interactive elements, responding to user actions in real-time. Together,
                    HTML provides the structure, CSS styles the presentation, and JavaScript adds dynamic behavior,
                    creating a fully functional and engaging web experience.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box">
                <h3>Web Design</h3>
                <p>Web design is the craft of creating visually engaging and user-friendly websites, blending aesthetics
                    with functionality. It involves designing the layout, color schemes, typography, and overall visual
                    appeal to ensure that a site is not only attractive but also intuitive to navigate. Key elements
                    include user experience (UX), which focuses on making the website easy to use and enjoyable, and
                    responsive design, which ensures that the site performs well across various devices and screen
                    sizes. Effective web design employs visual hierarchy to direct user attention to important content,
                    while typography and color theory contribute to readability and brand identity. Additionally,
                    accessibility considerations make sure the site is usable by people with diverse needs and
                    abilities. In essence, web design merges creativity with technical expertise to create a seamless
                    and engaging online experience.</p>
